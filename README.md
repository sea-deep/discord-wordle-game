### ⚙️ Configuration
In the `config.json` file, fill in the following fields:

* `emoji_stash_servers`: An array of server IDs where the bot can access the custom emojis that will be used in the game. Create 3 servers and invite your bot there and paste the servers' IDs in the array. It will get automatically set-up at the time of running! (**make sure your bot has Manage Emotes permission there**)
* `setup_required`: A boolean that determines whether the bot needs to set up custom emojis for the game. Leave this field as it is.
